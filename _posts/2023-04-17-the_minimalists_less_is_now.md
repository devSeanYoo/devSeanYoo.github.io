- The entire world is trying to persuade you to believe that you need something, something more than what you have now.
- Average household expenditure is at all time high due to cheap, convenient products that are constantly being bombarded.
- Living minimal means you have to work(not in the sense of earning income) more to maintain life. If not minimal, then you have everything to do chores instead of you.
- We need to create a space to fill our life, not living in whatever space we have.
- How many of the things in your life add value to your life?
- Happiness is not what you get from what you have, but rather from how you think
- Collected memories are not accumulated through past goods, but through memory. The less past goods you have, the more precious the memories become.
- Minimalism is not about having nothing. It is more about having things that actually add value to your life. Everything that you hold in your life should have some sort of usefulness to you.
- Start throwing away one thing each day, one thing that you are absolutely sure you do not need in your life. Or, box up everything in your life and only unpack the things that you need to live the next month. The rest would be not as necessary as you think.
- Having less means craving less. Craving less means being pressured less. Being pressured less means being content with what you have. Then you have some space to breathe in your busy life.
- Live an intentional life, where you design your life with things that you actually need, not things that the media is screaming at you to buy.
