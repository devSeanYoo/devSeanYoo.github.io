## Finding a Good Problem

Criteria | Description | Ideal Set
---------|------------|---------
**Popular** | Lots of ppl affected | Over 1 million users
**Growing** | More ppl will have that problem in near future | Market growing 20% per year
**Urgent** | Need to be solved quickly | Need to solve right now
**Expensive** | Costly to solve right now | Costs billions to solve right now
**Mandatory** | Problem that NEEDS to be solved | New laws or policies made 
**Frequent** | Ppl suffer from problem frequently | Ppl face the problem multiple times a day

- If your company is not growing or the investors are not interested, it is because there are things missing out of these

- **Behaviour =** **Motivation** to solve a problem **+** your **Ability** to make a solution **+ Trigger** to use your solution

- People do not regularly acknowledge the problem, so you need to remind them the problem over and over again

<br>

## Creating a Good Solution
- Do not start with the solution  
  - If you start with the solution, you need to appeal to the consumers that they have a problem.
  - If you start with the problem which the consumers already have acknowledged at least once, it is then easier to capture their attention.

## Insight (Compared with YC and Woofoo)
- Why is it your solution that will grow?
- You **MUST HAVE** an unfair advantage compared to other competitors related to growth, such as;
  - **Founder :** top 10% expert that can solve the problem 
    > ex. biotech expert with some sort of an award, but not many ppl actually qualify
  - **Market :** fast growing market 
    - But needs sth more than just this.
    - If the market is stagnant or shrinking, no investment.
  - **Product :** ten times better than that of competitors
    - Ppl should be crazy about it.
  - **Acquisition :** Acquisition path should cost $0
    > ex. Word of Mouth
    - The value of paid marketing diminishes as market matures.
    - It is great when you do not have money so that you can think of how to promote without creating any financial cost.
  - **Monopoly :** stronger as time goes and market grows 
    > ex.  
    > marketplace : winner takes all  
    > network effect : as market grows, more users acquired
