- We do not pay for social media services, thus not being the customer. Advertisers pay, thus them being the customer. The product would be our attention aka gradual imperceptible change in our behaviour and perception. The product is guaranteed by certainty based on colossal data, which track every single thing about us, such as the suggested posts on facebook regarding break-up after I broke up.
- Social media companies have three goals. First, engagement, which drives up usage and keep users scrolling. Second, growth, which have users return and invite more users to the platform. Third, advertising, which is to get profit by utilizing advertisements.
- Social media consists of psychology and neuroscience in order to keep viewers and earn profit. For example, new posts always comes up if you refresh your page which leads to more engagement. Also, the idea that you do not know what is going to pop up but the expectation of that post being useful to you is just like the slot machine for gambling which triggers human happiness. Another example is photo tagging. The notification shows you that you have been tagged but not the exact photo in order to have you press and do more activity.
- Social media exploits vulnerability of human psychology using subliminal cues.
- Tools just sit there in order to be used. If it demands something from you, it is no longer a tool. Social media has its own goal and pushes you for that goal.
- Two industries have customers and their ‘users’, illegal drugs and software.
- Social media forces social approval only to give vacancy in return, triggering you for more eagerness to get approved with likes, hearts, and thumbs-ups.
- Social media does not have regulations for kids like the traditional media.
- Social media is like a digital pacifier.
- Google search engine’s auto filling system depends on where you are searching.
- Specialized feeds suggested by social media creates an echo-chamber, causing polarization in the society. Such echo-chamber is used to trigger fake news where there is no check and balance anymore. COVID19 is an example for such fake news where people are trying to sell all shit of stuff to people who are afraid of the pandemic.
- Conclusion is there needs to be regulations for social media. Humane technology is the base for the Silicon Valley and we would have to remind ourselves of it.
